# d085_pa

This is most of what I used to complete the WGU performance assessment for D088 Automation and Scaling.  I used docker to test the scaling and mostly standard linux tools for performance metrics, some of which can be found in the recipes directory.

Disclaimer:
This is the repo I used to pass the class, the PA states:

"Code downloaded from the internet, other than Chef cookbooks, or acquired from another student or any other source may not be submitted and will result in automatic failure of this assessment."

Because of that, I've omitted everything I used except my cookbooks, but there really isn't a lot more required.

Feel free to use it as a reference, but do not copy it as it is against the rules for the performance assessment and WGU school policy.
